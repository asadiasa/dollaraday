    <p>Despite all the tragedies that we have faced so far in 2020, what amazes
    me the most is the wilingness of others to help out their community.
    I started this project to remind ourselves even when the hashtags have stopped
    trending, organizations still need your help.</p>
    <p>The challenge is to save a dollar every week day (M-F).
    At the end of the week, choose an organization to donate the funds to.
    As a college student, I know that money can be tight, so if you are unable to donate,
    I have also listed ways you can start cultivating a habit of giving.</p>
